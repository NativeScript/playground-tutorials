## Lesson 1. Getting Your App Up and Running

### Step 1. Starting your first app

![](images/nativescript-logo.png)

The environment you‚Äôre in right now is called **NativeScript Playground**.

NativeScript Playground is a browser-based environment for developing simple NativeScript apps. It‚Äôs a great place to get started learning NativeScript, as you can develop apps without needing to install the various SDKs and tools needed for native iOS and Android development. All you need to complete this guide is an iOS or Android device.

> **TIP**:
> * This tutorial is for using NativeScript with Angular. If you'd prefer to stick with plain JavaScript, check out [our tutorial on NativeScript Core](/?template=groceries-js&tutorial=groceries-js), the dependency-free version of NativeScript.
> * The pane you‚Äôre viewing this tutorial in is expandable. Try expanding or collapsing it to find a width that works for you.

Let‚Äôs see the NativeScript Playground in action.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Get out an Android or iOS device. You need at least one device to complete this tutorial.

* **b.** Download and install the **NativeScript Playground** app on your device by either searching for ‚ÄúNativeScript Playground‚Äù in the iOS App Store or Google Play, or by using the links below.

[![](images/google-play.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nativescript.play)

* **c.** Download and install the **NativeScript Preview** app on your device by either searching for ‚ÄúNativeScript Preview‚Äù in the iOS App Store or Google Play, or by using the links below.

* **d.** Open the **NativeScript Playground** app on your device(s), and click the **Scan QR code** action.

* **e.** In your web browser, click the **QR Code** button at the top of the Playground interface.

* **f.** Scan the QR code in your browser with your device; you should see an app that looks like the screenshots below.

<hr data-action="end" />

And with that, you‚Äôre running your first NativeScript app on your device! Now that you have your app up and running, let‚Äôs start tinkering.

### Step 2. Establishing a development workflow

NativeScript lets you develop native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript. One of the advantages of this approach is that NativeScript can update your apps quickly, as NativeScript doesn‚Äôt have to run bytecode builds every time a file changes.

Let‚Äôs see this in action by making a few updates.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your app‚Äôs `app/home/home.component.html` file (it might already be open), find the first `<Label>` component (the one with `text="Play with NativeScript!"`), and replace that component with the following one.

``` HTML
<Label text="üî• NativeScript üî•" fontSize="40"></Label>
```

* **b**. Save the change by typing `Ctrl` + `S` on Windows or `Cmd` + `S` on macOS. The app on your device should automatically update.

> **TIP**
> * You can develop on multiple devices simultaneously. If you have multiple iOS or Android devices, download the **NativeScript Playground** app on each and scan this app‚Äôs QR code.
> * In NativeScript Playground the `Ctrl` + `S` or `Cmd` + `S` keyboard shortcut saves all your files. Later in this guide you‚Äôll be changing multiple files, and you can use that single keyboard shortcut to save all of them at the same time.

<hr data-action="end" />

One of the biggest benefits of using NativeScript is the fast development workflow you just saw in action. You have the ability to change your code and see those changes instantly‚Äîeven on multiple devices.

> **TIP**:
> * You can save your current Playground work by clicking the **Save** button at the top. This will generate a URL that you can bookmark for future use.
> * If you want to continue developing this app locally, you can use the **Download** button at the top of the screen. After you download the app, you should install the NativeScript CLI by running the `npm i nativescript -g` command, and then execute the `tns preview` command to preview your work - just as you do in Playground.

In NativeScript you use native iOS and Android user interface components to build your app; NativeScript does not use a WebView or web browser in any way. This isn‚Äôt obvious when using a simple `<Label>`, so let‚Äôs make one more change so you can get a sense of just what NativeScript makes possible.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a**. Open your `app/home/home.component.html` file and replace its contents with the following code, which uses NativeScript‚Äôs chart UI component.

> **NOTE:** Don‚Äôt worry about exactly what this code is doing at the moment. You‚Äôll learn about how Angular and NativeScript work in upcoming tutorials.

``` XML
<ActionBar title="Groceries"></ActionBar>

<GridLayout>
    <RadCartesianChart>
        <CategoricalAxis tkCartesianHorizontalAxis></CategoricalAxis>
        <LinearAxis tkCartesianVerticalAxis></LinearAxis>
        <BarSeries tkCartesianSeries [items]="favoriteFruits" categoryProperty="type" valueProperty="count"></BarSeries>
    </RadCartesianChart>
</GridLayout>
```

* **b.** Next, open your `app/home/home.component.ts` file and replace its contents with the following code.

``` TypeScript
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
    selector: "Home",
    moduleId: module.id,
    templateUrl: "./home.component.html",
    styleUrls: ['./home.component.css']
})
export class HomeComponent implements OnInit {
    favoriteFruits = [
        { type: "üçé", count: 7 },
        { type: "üçå", count: 15 },
        { type: "üçç", count: 12 },
        { type: "üçí", count: 30 },
        { type: "üçá", count: 16 }
    ];

    constructor() {
    }

    ngOnInit(): void {
    }
}
```

You should see the following charts on your device.

<hr data-action="end" />

You now have an app using completely native iOS and Android charts in a handful of lines of code. Cool, right?

Now that you have some background on how NativeScript Playground works, let‚Äôs look at [how to build a complete app](https://play.nativescript.org/?template=groceries-ng&tutorial=groceries-ng).

> **TIP:** Take a minute to note the **Errors** section at the bottom of the NativeScript Playground screen. If you hit any errors during these tutorials you‚Äôll see them in this panel.
