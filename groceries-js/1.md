## Lesson 1. Learn the NativeScript Basics

### Step 1. Get your first app up and running

The environment you‚Äôre in right now is called **NativeScript Playground**.

NativeScript Playground is a browser-based environment for developing simple NativeScript apps. It‚Äôs a great place to get started learning NativeScript, as you can develop apps without needing to install the various SDKs and tools needed for native iOS and Android development. All you need to complete this guide is an iOS or Android device.

> **TIP**:
> * The pane you‚Äôre viewing this tutorial in is expandable. Try expanding or collapsing it to find a width that works for you.

Let‚Äôs see the NativeScript Playground in action.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Get out an Android or iOS device. You need at least one device to complete this tutorial.

* **b.** Download and install the **NativeScript Playground** app on your device by either searching for ‚ÄúNativeScript Playground‚Äù in the iOS App Store or Google Play, or by using the links below.

[![](images/google-play.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nativescript.play)

* **c.** Download and install the **NativeScript Preview** app on your device by either searching for ‚ÄúNativeScript Preview‚Äù in the iOS App Store or Google Play, or by using the links below.

[![](images/google-play.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nativescript.preview)

* **d.** Open the **NativeScript Playground** app on your device(s), and click the **Scan QR code** action.

* **e.** In your web browser, click the **QR Code** button at the top of the Playground interface.

![](images/generate-qr-code.png)

* **f.** Scan the QR code in your browser with your device; you should see a simple ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù app appear.

<hr data-action="end" />

And with that, you‚Äôre running your first NativeScript app on your device! Now that you have your app up and running, let‚Äôs start tinkering.

### Step 2. Establishing a development workflow

NativeScript lets you develop native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript. One of the advantages of this approach is that NativeScript can update your apps quickly, as NativeScript doesn‚Äôt have to run bytecode builds every time a file changes.

Let‚Äôs see this in action by making a few updates.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your app‚Äôs `app/views/login/login-page.xml` file, and replace its contents with the code below, which updates the label‚Äôs text.

``` XML
<Page>
    <Label text='hello NativeScript'/>
</Page>
```

* **b**. Save the change by typing `Ctrl` + `S` on Windows or `Cmd` + `S` on macOS. The app on your device should automatically update.

> **TIP**
> * You can develop on multiple devices simultaneously. If you have multiple iOS or Android devices, download the **NativeScript Playground** app on each and scan this app‚Äôs QR code.
> * In NativeScript Playground the `Ctrl` + `S` or `Cmd` + `S` keyboard shortcut saves all your files. Later in this guide you‚Äôll be changing multiple files, and you can use that single keyboard shortcut to save all of them at the same time.

<hr data-action="end" />

One of the biggest benefits of using NativeScript is the fast development workflow you just saw in action. You have the ability to change your code and see those changes instantly‚Äîeven on multiple devices.

> **TIP**: You can save your current Playground work by clicking the **Share** button at the top. This will generate a URL that you can bookmark for future use.

In NativeScript you use native iOS and Android user interface components to build your app; NativeScript does not use a WebView or web browser in any way. This isn‚Äôt obvious when using a simple `<Label>`, so let‚Äôs make one more change so you can get a sense of just what NativeScript makes possible.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a**. Open your `app/views/login/login-page.js` file and replace its contents with the following code, which will be used to fill a chart.

> **NOTE:** Don‚Äôt worry about exactly what this code is doing at the moment. You‚Äôll learn about how the pieces fit together in the next lesson.

``` JavaScript
var observableModule = require("tns-core-modules/data/observable");

function LoginViewModel() {
    var viewModel = observableModule.fromObject({

        favoriteFruits: [
            { type: "üçé", count: 7 },
            { type: "üçå", count: 15 },
            { type: "üçç", count: 12 },
            { type: "üçí", count: 30 },
            { type: "üçá", count: 16 }
        ]
    });

    return viewModel;
}

var loginViewModel = LoginViewModel();

function pageLoaded(args) {
    var page = args.object;
    page.bindingContext = loginViewModel;
}

exports.pageLoaded = pageLoaded;
```

* **b**. Open your `app/views/login/login-page.xml` file and replace its contents with the following code, which will be used to build the chart.

```XML
<Page loaded="pageLoaded" xmlns="http://www.nativescript.org/tns.xsd">
    <ActionBar title="Groceries"></ActionBar>
    <GridLayout rows="auto, *" xmlns:chart="nativescript-ui-chart" style="height: 1000px">
        <chart:RadCartesianChart id="cartesianChart" style="height: 100%">
            <chart:RadCartesianChart.series>
                <chart:BarSeries items="{{ favoriteFruits }}" categoryProperty="type" valueProperty="count">
                    <chart:BarSeries.horizontalAxis>
                        <chart:CategoricalAxis/>
                    </chart:BarSeries.horizontalAxis>
                    <chart:BarSeries.verticalAxis>
                        <chart:LinearAxis/>
                    </chart:BarSeries.verticalAxis>
                </chart:BarSeries>
            </chart:RadCartesianChart.series>
        </chart:RadCartesianChart>
    </GridLayout>
</Page>
```

* **c.** Save your `app/views/login/login-page.xml` file. You should see the following charts on your device.

> **NOTE**: Groceries is the name of the app you‚Äôll be building in this tutorial.

<hr data-action="end" />

You now have an app using completely native iOS and Android charts in a handful of lines of code. Cool, right?

Now that you have some background on how NativeScript Playground works, in the next lesson you‚Äôll learn about NativeScript by building a complete app from scratch.

> **TIP:** Take a minute to note the **Errors** section at the bottom of the NativeScript Playground screen. If you hit any errors during this tutorial you‚Äôll see them in this pane.
