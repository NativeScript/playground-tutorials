## Lesson 2. Adding Application Logic

In this lesson you’ll learn how to add TypeScript logic to your app, how to create services that talk to backend endpoints, and how to architect an app to share code with Angular web apps. There’s a lot to cover, so let’s start by discussing how to handle events and data binding.

> **TIP**: The final state of this tutorial is available [here](https://play.nativescript.org/?id=WhQU5V&v=786), and you can refer to it at any time if you get stuck.

### Step 6. Handling events

Most user interfaces are driven by events. In NativeScript apps, those events are usually some user action, such as tapping, swiping, or rotating. NativeScript abstracts the iOS- and Android-specific code for handling such events into a handful of easy-to-use APIs. Let’s start with the most common event you’ll use in a NativeScript app: `tap`.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/login/login.component.html` file, find the existing sign in button within your component’s `template` (`<Button text="Sign in" class="btn btn-primary"></Button>`), and replace it with the following code.

``` XML
<Button text="Sign in" class="btn btn-primary" (tap)="submit()"></Button>
```

* **b.** Next, open your `app/app.component.ts` file, and replace the current `AppComponent` declaration (`export class AppComponent {}`) with the one shown below.

``` JavaScript
export class AppComponent {
  submit() {
    console.log("hello");
  }
}
```

* **c.** Save your files. When your app refreshes on your device, tap the **Sign in** button. You should see “hello” listed in the **Device Logs** section of Playground in your browser.

<hr data-action="end" />

The `(eventName)="functionName()"` syntax is part of [Angular’s event binding system](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html#!#event-binding), which lets you bind an event that occurs on a UI element to a function in your component’s class. In this case, the `(tap)="submit()"` syntax tells Angular to run the `AppComponent` class’s `submit()` function whenever the user taps the sign in button.

> **TIP**:
> * You can find a list of events available for each UI element on its API documentation page. For instance, the [button element’s API documentation](http://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/classes/_ui_button_.button.html) lists its `tap` event.
> * The Angular docs have a helpful [cheat sheet](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/cheatsheet.html) that includes the various syntaxes available when building templates. Don’t worry too much about knowing how all these work at the moment; you’ll use the most common syntaxes as you complete this guide.

With the `tap` event in place, you now have a way of tying the UI elements in your template to your TypeScript code. To make a login page actually work though, we need to introduce one other way of connecting a template to code: data binding.

### Step 7. Binding to data

Angular provides several ways to bind data in your TypeScript code to UI controls, and through the magic of NativeScript those same methods are available in your iOS and Android apps.

The first of these is a way to bind UI attributes to properties defined in your TypeScript class. Let’s look at how it works.

<hr data-action="start">

#### Action

* **a.** In your `app/app.component.ts` file, replace the current `AppComponent` declaration with the one shown below, which adds a new `email` property, and changes the `submit()` method to display its value:

``` JavaScript
export class AppComponent {
  email = "nativescriptrocks@progress.com";
  submit() {
    alert("You’re using: " + this.email);
  }
}
```

* **b.** Next, open your `app/login/login.component.html` file, find the first `<TextField>`, and replace it with the code below, which adds a new `text` attribute.

``` XML
<TextField hint="Email Address" keyboardType="email"
  autocorrect="false" autocapitalizationType="none"
  [text]="email" class="input input-border"></TextField>
```

* **c.** Save your files. When your app refreshes on your device you should see the “nativescriptrocks” email address prefilled.

![](images/ios-9.png)
![](images/android-9.png)

<hr data-action="end">

The key thing to note here is the `[text]="email"` attribute on the `<TextField>`. This is Angular’s syntax for attribute binding, and it allows you to bind the value of an attribute to a property in your TypeScript class. In this case, the `text` attribute of the `<TextField>`—which is roughly equivalent to a DOM `<input>`’s `value` attribute—is bound to the `AppComponent`’s `email` property.

> **NOTE**: It’s very easy to confuse Angular’s event binding syntax `(eventName)="functionName()"` with its attribute binding syntax `[attributeName]="propertyName"`. Don’t worry though; if you get them backwards, the problem is usually easy to debug, as the functionality you’re attempting to add just won’t work. These syntaxes are common enough that you’ll be using them a lot, and eventually you should be able to commit them to memory.

#### Background: One-way binding versus two-way binding

The binding you used in the previous example is known as one-way binding, and it works well when you need TypeScript properties—and changes to those properties done in TypeScript code—to appear in the user interface. But in the case of UI components that accept user input, such as the text field in this example, usually you need data binding to work two way. Using two-way binding ensures that the values the user types into UI components are available in your TypeScript code.

If you’d like to confirm that your app is currently using one-way binding only, head back to your app and change the email text field’s value (type a few extra letters or something like that), and then tap the **Sign In** button. Because your `submit()` function alerts the current value of the component’s `email` property—`alert("You’re using: " + this.email)`—you might expect to see the updated value in the alert. Instead, however, you see the original value.

To avoid this problem you’ll need to use two-way binding for these form controls, which is exactly what the next section has you do.

#### End Background

Next, let’s look at how to implement two-way binding in an Angular app.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/login/login.component.html` file, find the first `<TextField>`, and replace it with the `<TextField>` below, which introduces a new `[(ngModel)]` attribute:

``` XML
<TextField hint="Email Address" keyboardType="email"
  autocorrect="false" autocapitalizationType="none"
  [(ngModel)]="email" class="input input-border"></TextField>
```

* **b.** Next, open your `app/app.module.ts` file, and replaces its contents with the code below, which adds a new `NativeScriptFormsModule` to the `NgModule`’s list of `imports`.

``` JavaScript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { NativeScriptFormsModule } from "nativescript-angular/forms";
import { NativeScriptModule } from "nativescript-angular/nativescript.module";

import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NativeScriptModule,
    NativeScriptFormsModule
  ],
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> **NOTE**: You can think of the list of `imports` in an Angular module as the pieces of functionality needed to make your app work. In this case, the `NativeScriptFormsModule` makes the `[(ngModel)]` syntax work with NativeScript’s UI components. If you want to dive into exactly how Angular imports work, refer to [Angular’s documentation on modules](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/ngmodule.html).

* **c.** Save your files.

* **d.** After your app updates on your device, make a change to the email address (type a few extra characters or something), and tap the app’s **Sign in** button. You should now see the updated email address in an alert.

![](images/ios-10.png)
![](images/android-10.png)

<hr data-action="end" />

At first glance the `[(ngModel)]` syntax looks more than a little odd, as it’s essentially a combination of the event and attribute binding syntax that you used in earlier examples. In the case of this example, `[(ngModel)]="email"` is shorthand for `[text]="email" (textChange)="email=$event.object.text"`, which binds the email element’s `text` attribute to an `email` property and adds a `change` event handler that updates the `email` property’s value whenever the user makes a change.

Don’t worry too much about the details of this syntax while you’re getting started. In your head you can think of `[(ngModel)]` as the way to implement two-way data binding when you need it on form controls.

Before we move on, let’s make one additional change to show what else you can do with Angular’s data binding APIs. The Groceries app uses the same UI for the **Sign In** form and the **Sign Up** form. Therefore, when the user taps **Sign Up**, you need to update the text of the buttons (and eventually the functionality that occurs when you tap them). Let’s see how to make that happen.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/login/login.component.html` file and replace the two existing `<Button>`s with the code below.

``` XML
<Button [text]="isLoggingIn ? 'Sign in' : 'Sign up'"
  class="btn btn-primary" (tap)="submit()"></Button>
<Button [text]="isLoggingIn ? 'Sign up' : 'Back to login'"
  (tap)="toggleDisplay()"></Button>
```

* **b.** Next, open your `app/app.component.ts` file, and replace the existing `AppComponent` declaration with the code below, which adds a new `isLoggingIn` property, and a new `toggleDisplay()` method:

``` JavaScript
export class AppComponent {
  email = "nativescriptrocks@progress.com";
  isLoggingIn = true;

  submit() {
    alert("You’re using: " + this.email);
  }

  toggleDisplay() {
    this.isLoggingIn = !this.isLoggingIn;
  }
}
```

* **c.** Save your files.

* **d.** After your app updates on your device, tap the bottom button a few times. Notice how Angular is smart enough to update the button text when the TypeScript property changes.

![](images/ios-11.gif)
![](images/android-11.gif)

<hr data-action="end" />

At this point, you have a basic login screen setup with two-way data binding—which isn’t bad for ~20 lines of TypeScript. (Think about how much code you’d have to write in Android Studio _and_ Xcode to accomplish the same task.) To this point though you’ve been placing all of your logic in a single TypeScript file, which doesn’t scale all that well for real-world applications.

Before we tie this app to a backend and make this login screen fully functional, let’s take a step back and set up a structure that can scale.

### Step 8. Structuring your app

There are many reasons to segment any application into modular units, and you can [read about the various benefits on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming). Modularizing NativeScript has one additional, unique benefit: the ability to share the code you write between Angular-built web apps, and Angular-built native apps.

Even if you have no plans to create an Angular web app, separating out your code is still advantageous for a number of other reasons—testability, ease of maintenance, and so forth—but if you _do_ have plans to build an Angular web app, having a chunk of functionality that you can reuse in your native and web apps can be an invaluable time saver.

> **TIP**: NativeScript provides a way to build Angular web and native apps from a single code base using the Angular CLI. You can [learn more about this approach on the NativeScript documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/code-sharing/intro).

To see how this works in action, let’s edit some files in your `shared` folder and set them up to be imported.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/shared/user/user.model.ts` file, and paste in the following code.

``` JavaScript
export class User {
  email: string;
  password: string;
}
```

> **NOTE**: This code defines a simple [TypeScript class](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook#classes) that does nothing more than define two properties—`email` and `password`. Note the use of [TypeScript’s `export` keyword](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook#modules-going-external), as we’ll see why that’s important momentarily.

* **b.** Next, open your `app/app.component.ts` file and add the following `import` at the top.

``` JavaScript
import { User } from "./shared/user/user.model";
```

With this line of code you import the `User` class that you just defined. Note the parallel between the `export` command used in the previous example and the `import` command used here. The reason the `User` class is available to import is because it was explicitly exported. You’ll see other examples of `import` and `export` as you go through this guide.

* **c.** While still in `app/app.component.ts`, replace the existing `AppComponent` definition with the one below, which uses the `User` class you just imported.

``` JavaScript
export class AppComponent {
  user: User;
  isLoggingIn = true;

  constructor() {
    this.user = new User();
  }

  submit() {
    alert("You’re using: " + this.user.email);
  }

  toggleDisplay() {
    this.isLoggingIn = !this.isLoggingIn;
  }
}
```

Instead of storing data on the `AppComponent` directly, you’re now using the `User` model object, which is reusable outside of this page and even outside of this application. You instantiate an instance of the `User` class in a new `constructor` function, which Angular invokes when it bootstraps your application.

* **d.** Your last step is to use this new model object in your template. To do that, open your `app/login/login.component.html` file, and replace the two existing `<TextField>`s with the code shown below, which updates the `[(ngModel)]` bindings to point at the new `User` object:

``` XML
<TextField hint="Email Address" keyboardType="email"
  autocorrect="false" autocapitalizationType="none"
  [(ngModel)]="user.email" class="input input-border"></TextField>
<TextField hint="Password" secure="true"
  [(ngModel)]="user.password" class="input input-border"></TextField>
```

* **e.** When your app updates, ensure the app still works as expected. You didn’t add any new functionality in this step, but you now have a modular structure to move forward with.

<hr data-action="end" />

With this setup you now have a `User` class that you can share across pages in your app and even across applications. But a model object that’s four lines of code isn’t all that exciting. Where this approach really pays off is when you’re able to share your business logic, and the code that hits your backend systems. In Angular those classes are known as services. Let’s look at them next.

### Step 9. Building services

A login screen isn’t all that useful if it doesn’t actually log users into anything. Therefore, our next task is to allow users to create and log into accounts. We’ll build this functionality as an [Angular service](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-services), which is Angular’s mechanism for reusable classes that operate on data.

> **NOTE**: For the purposes of this tutorial we pre-provided a few RESTful endpoints for handling authentication and data management. In NativeScript you can use any HTTP-based APIs to power your app and there are a number of NativeScript plugins for getting up and running with common solutions such as [Firebase](https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-plugin-firebase), [Couchbase](https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-couchbase), [Kinvey](https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/kinvey-nativescript-sdk), and more.

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** Open your `app/shared/user/user.service.ts` file and paste in the following code, which defines a simple `register()` method.

``` JavaScript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

import { User } from "./user.model";

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  register(user: User) {
    alert("About to register: " + user.email);
  }
}
```

> **NOTE**: This creates a basic Angular service with a single method that takes an instance of the `User` object you created in the previous section. The one new thing is the `@Injectable` decorator. This decorator denotes this class as a candidate for [Angular’s dependency injection mechanism](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/dependency-injection.html). For now just think of adding the `@Injectable` as a required convention for all services that you write.

* **b.** Next, add the following line to the top of your `app/app.component.ts` file, which imports the service you just defined.

``` JavaScript
import { UserService } from "./shared/user/user.service";
```

* **c.** After that, in the same `app.component.ts` file, add a new `providers` property to the existing `@Component` decorator. The full `@Component` declaration should now look like this.

``` JavaScript
@Component({
  selector: "gr-login",
  providers: [UserService],
  moduleId: module.id,
  styleUrls: ["./login/login.component.css"],
  templateUrl: "./login/login.component.html"
})
```

> **NOTE:** The `providers` array is a simple list of all the Angular services that you need to use in your component. At the moment you only have one service, so your `providers` array only has one entry.

* **d.** Next, replace `AppComponent`’s existing `constructor` with the code below, which adds the new `UserService` as a parameter. (We’ll discuss exactly what’s going on here in a moment.)

``` JavaScript
constructor(private userService: UserService) {
  this.user = new User();
}
```

* **e.** After that, **remove** the existing `submit()` method in your `AppComponent` class. (You’ll add a new one in the next step.)

* **f.** Finally, **add** the the following three methods to your `AppComponent` class.

``` JavaScript
submit() {
  if (this.isLoggingIn) {
    this.login();
  } else {
    this.signUp();
  }
}

login() {
  // TODO: Define
}

signUp() {
  this.userService.register(this.user);
}
```

* **g.** Save your files.

* **h.** When your app refreshes on your device, tap the **Sign up** button, type an email address, and tap the **Sign up** button again. If all went well you should see the following alert.

![](images/ios-12.png)
![](images/android-12.png)

<hr data-action="end" />

Before we move on, let’s return to this bit of code.

``` JavaScript
constructor(private userService: UserService) {
  this.user = new User();
}
```

This is Angular’s dependency injection implementation in action. Because you registered `UserService` as a provider in this component’s `providers` array, when Angular sees this syntax it creates an instance of the `UserService` class, and passes that instance into the component’s constructor.

#### Background: Why dependency injection?

This example begs the question—why bother with all this syntax to set up dependency injection? Why not run `this.userService = new UserService()` in the component’s constructor and forget the complexity of `@Injectable` and `providers`?

The short answer is a dependency-injection-based approach to coding keeps your classes less coupled, and therefore more maintainable and testable as your application evolves over time. For a longer answer, head over to the Angular’s docs for a [thorough discussion of the benefits of dependency injection](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/dependency-injection.html).

#### End Background

Let’s return to our example and make the registration process actually work.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/shared/user/user.service.ts` file and replaces its contents with the following code, which we’ll discuss in detail in a moment.

``` JavaScript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { HttpClient, HttpHeaders, HttpResponse } from "@angular/common/http";
import { Observable, throwError } from "rxjs";
import { catchError, map, tap } from "rxjs/operators";

import { User } from "./user.model";
import { Config } from "../config";

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
    constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

    register(user: User) {
        if (!user.email || !user.password) {
            return throwError("Please provide both an email address and password.");
        }

        return this.http.post(
            Config.apiUrl + "user/" + Config.appKey,
            JSON.stringify({
                username: user.email,
                email: user.email,
                password: user.password
            }),
            { headers: this.getCommonHeaders() }
        ).pipe(
            catchError(this.handleErrors)
        );
    }

    getCommonHeaders() {
        return {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Authorization": Config.authHeader
        }
    }

    handleErrors(error: Response) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(error));
        return throwError(error);
    }
}
```

* **b.** Next, open your `app/app.component.ts` file, and replace the existing `signUp()` function with the following code.

``` JavaScript
signUp() {
  this.userService.register(this.user)
    .subscribe(
      () => {
        alert("Your account was successfully created.");
        this.toggleDisplay();
      },
      (exception) => {
          if(exception.error && exception.error.description) {
              alert(exception.error.description);
          } else {
              alert(exception)
          }
      }
    );
}
```

* **c.** Save your files, but don’t bother testing on your device quite yet. (You’ll get an error if you do). Let’s take a minute to discuss what’s going on in the code you just added first.

<hr data-action="end" />

The first thing to note here is the new `constructor` code in `user.service.ts`.

``` JavaScript
constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
```

The `UserService` class is using the same dependency injection technique to bring in a service that it needs, in this case the Http class, which is Angular’s way of letting you perform HTTP calls. And thanks to NativeScript, those same HTTP APIs work on iOS and Android without any extra work.

> **TIP**: Refer to [Angular’s docs on Http](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/http/index/Http-class.html) for specifics on what HTTP APIs are available.

The other new bit of code is the return value of this new `register()` method. `register()` returns `this.http.post()`, which is an RxJS `Observable`. You can refer to the Angular docs for a [full tutorial on how RxJS observables work](https://angular.io/guide/http#observables-and-operators), but for now just know that the most common thing you’ll need to do with observables is subscribe to them, which is what the new code you added to `app.component.ts` does.

``` JavaScript
this.userService.register(this.user)
  .subscribe(
    () => {
      alert("Your account was successfully created.");
      this.toggleDisplay();
    },
    (exception) => {
        if(exception.error && exception.error.description) {
            alert(exception.error.description);
        } else {
            alert(exception)
        }
    }
  );
```

The two functions you pass `subscribe()` are success and failure handlers. If the call to `register()` succeeds, your first alert will fire, and if the call to `register()` fails, your second alert will fire. Now that your service code is set up and ready to go, let’s make the final few changes and create an account.

#### Background: ES2015 arrow functions, aka the `() => {}` syntax

The `() => {}` syntax defines an [ES2015 arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), which TypeScript supports out of the box. In this example, the arrow functions are the equivalent of writing `function() {}`. Arrow functions have the advantage of inheriting their context—aka `this`—from their parents. Note how the code above is able to call `this.toggleDisplay()` from an inner function, which would not work with a generic JavaScript `function() {}`.

#### End Background

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

Because the `UserService` makes use of the `Http` service, your final step is registering the `Http` provider, much like you did with `UserService`. Although you could do this in your `app.component.ts` file, this time you’re going to take a slightly different approach.

* **a.** Open your `app/app.module.ts` file and replace its contents with the following code, which adds a new `NativeScriptHttpClientModule` to the list of `imports`.

``` JavaScript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { NativeScriptFormsModule } from "nativescript-angular/forms";
import { NativeScriptHttpClientModule } from "nativescript-angular/http-client";
import { NativeScriptModule } from "nativescript-angular/nativescript.module";

import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NativeScriptModule,
    NativeScriptFormsModule,
    NativeScriptHttpClientModule
  ],
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> **NOTE**: `NativeScriptHttpClientModule` is a NativeScript wrapper of Angular’s [`HttpModule`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/http/index/HttpModule-class.html), a module that declares all of Angular’s HTTP-based services—including the `HttpClient` service that `UserService` uses.

* **b.** At this point you should be ready to create an account to verify that this whole setup worked. After your app updates on your device, tap the **Sign up** button in your app.

* **c.** Next, type in an email address and password you’d like to use testing for the remainder of the tutorial. Fake credentials are fine, just make up something you can remember.

* **d.** Tap the red **Sign up** button. You should see a confirmation dialog that looks like this.

<hr data-action="end" />

#### Background: Hierarchical dependency injectors

Angular supports the concept of [hierarchical dependency injectors](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection.html), which is a fancy way of saying that you can import providers in parent modules and use them in child components.

In this example, this concept means you can declare `NativeScriptHttpClientModule` in your `app.module.ts` file, even though the `HttpClient` service is used in `UserService`. Generally, it’s only a good idea to declare providers in parent modules if most of the components in your app need access to the provider. Although you _could_ declare all your providers in a single root `NgModule`, your list of imports would become unwieldy as your app grows, and difficult to refactor as your app changes.

#### End Background

Your app now has a fully functional registration process, but users can’t do anything with the accounts they create. Our next step is to allow the users to login and navigate to a new list page. And to do that we need to introduce the concept of routing.

> **TIP**:  After creating your account, you may wish to hardcode your credentials in your `AppComponent`’s `constructor()` to make development faster for the rest of this guide.

``` JavaScript
constructor(private userService: UserService) {
  this.user = new User();
  this.user.email = "my.test.account@nativescript.org";
  this.user.password = "mypassword";
}
```

### Step 10. Add navigation with routing

Most of the Angular concepts you’ve used in the last few sections are the same regardless of whether you’re building for the web or native apps. You are even able to share model objects and services directly between the two environments.

Routing is similar, but there are some differences. Routing on the web revolves around the concept of a URL, but in a native app there is no browser. Likewise, native apps have concepts that aren’t present in the browser, such as Android’s hardware back button, or iOS’s swipe left-to-right gesture to go back.

Let’s look at how NativeScript handles this by implementing routing in Groceries.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

To this point you’ve been putting your login page code in `app.component.ts`. Let’s move that logic into the `login` folder to make room for additional pages.

* **a.** Open your `app/app.component.ts` file, and copy its contents into your `app/login/login.component.ts` file.

* **b.** Open your `app/login/login.component.ts` file, and fix the `styleUrls` and `templateUrl` paths:

``` JavaScript
@Component({
    selector: "gr-login",
    providers: [UserService],
    moduleId: module.id,
    styleUrls: ["./login.component.css"],
    templateUrl: "./login.component.html"
})
```

* **c.** Next, in your new `app/login/login.component.ts` file, change the name of the class from `AppComponent` to `LoginComponent`.

* **d.** After that, in the same file, update the two broken `User` and `UserService` imports to use the code below.

``` JavaScript
import { User } from "../shared/user/user.model";
import { UserService } from "../shared/user/user.service";
```

* **e.** Next, open your `app/app.routing.ts` file and paste in the following code.

``` JavaScript
import { LoginComponent } from "./login/login.component";

export const routes = [
  { path: "", component: LoginComponent }
];

export const navigatableComponents = [
  LoginComponent
];
```

The `app/app.routing.ts` file is where you declare a list of all your app’s routes. Right now your `routes` array has a single route for the login page, but you’ll add more momentarily. To get this app running you need to make two more changes.

* **f.** Open your `app/app.module.ts` file, and replace the file’s contents with the following code, which adds a new `NativeScriptRouterModule` import, as well as imports the routes you just declared in `app.routing.ts`.

``` JavaScript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { NativeScriptFormsModule } from "nativescript-angular/forms";
import { NativeScriptHttpClientModule } from "nativescript-angular/http-client";
import { NativeScriptModule } from "nativescript-angular/nativescript.module";
import { NativeScriptRouterModule } from "nativescript-angular/router";

import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
import { routes, navigatableComponents } from "./app.routing";

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NativeScriptModule,
    NativeScriptFormsModule,
    NativeScriptHttpClientModule,
    NativeScriptRouterModule,
    NativeScriptRouterModule.forRoot(routes)
  ],
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    ...navigatableComponents
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> **NOTE**: An `NgModule`’s `declarations` array expects a list of the components that you’ll be using in your app. In this case you’re adding the `navigatableComponents` array you exported in your `app.routing.ts` file to the `AppComponent` declaration you already had. The `...` operator is [ES2015 spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator), and it’s easiest to explain what it does with a quick example. If you declare a variable `x` as `let x = [2, 3]`, then JavaScript will interpret `[1, ...x]` as `[1, 2, 3]`.

* **g.** After that, open your `app/app.component.ts` file back up and paste in the following code. We’ll discuss this file in detail momentarily.

``` JavaScript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "gr-app",
  template: "<page-router-outlet></page-router-outlet>"
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

* **h.** And finally, open your `app/main.ts` file, and replace its contents with the following code, which removes the `createFrameOnBootstrap` option, as it’s no longer necessary now that you have routing in place.

``` TypeScript
import { platformNativeScriptDynamic } from "nativescript-angular/platform";
import { enableProdMode } from "@angular/core";

import { AppModule } from "./app.module";

enableProdMode();
platformNativeScriptDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
```

> **NOTE**: You can read more about the `createFrameOnBootstrap` option [here](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#nativescript-40-compatible-bootstrap-and-navigation), but for apps with routing you’re safe to ignore the option altogether.

* **i.** Save your files.

* **j.** After your app updates on your device, ensure the login page continues to load as expected.

<hr data-action="end" />

If you haven’t played with routing in Angular before, you can refer to [Angular’s guide on the topic](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html) for some background, but the basic concept is you need to declare a `routes` array that includes a list of all components the user can navigate to, as well as a path to use to access those components. When you need to add new routes, you import the appropriate component in your `app.routing.ts` file, and then you include that component in your `routes` array.

#### Background: Using Angular directives

The `<page-router-outlet>` tag is your app’s first directive. You can again check out Angular’s docs if you want [detailed information on what directives are and do](https://angular.io/guide/attribute-directives), but the simplest way to think of a directive is as something that can affect the markup you put in your `template`—in this case `<page-router-outlet>`.

#### End Background

#### Background: Page routing in NativeScript

The code you use for routing in NativeScript apps is almost the same as it is in Angular web apps. The one big difference is that you use a `<page-router-outlet>` directive in NativeScript instead of a `<router-outlet>` directive.

The `<page-router-outlet>` is a NativeScript extension of Angular’s router makes native concepts such as page transitions work automatically in your iOS and Android apps, as you’ll see in a minute. The great thing is those details are transparent to you as a developer—you get these transitions automatically.

#### End Background

You’ve now successfully added a router, but you haven’t gotten to see it action as your app still only has one route. Let’s add a new route to Groceries to try this out.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/list/list.component.ts` file and paste in the following code, which you’ll use as the start of a simple list page.

``` JavaScript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "gr-list",
  moduleId: module.id,
  templateUrl: "./list.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./list.component.css"]
})
export class ListComponent {}
```

* **b.** For now, we’ll keep the list page simple so you can see how the routing works. But so that there’s something to see, open your `app/list/list.component.html` file and paste in the following `<Label>`.

``` XML
<ActionBar title="Groceries"></ActionBar>
<Label text="Hello world"></Label>
```

* **c.** After that, go back to your `app/app.routing.ts` file, and update the file with the following code.

``` JavaScript
import { LoginComponent } from "./login/login.component";
import { ListComponent } from "./list/list.component";

export const routes = [
  { path: "", component: LoginComponent },
  { path: "list", component: ListComponent }
];

export const navigatableComponents = [
  LoginComponent,
  ListComponent
];
```

* **d.** Save your files. There’s nothing to test on your device quite yet.

<hr data-action="end" />

Angular now knows about the list page, but we still need to navigate the user to that page at the appropriate time. Your last task for this lesson is to allow users to log into their accounts, and then to navigate them to the new list page after they have successfully authenticated.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a**. Open your `app/shared/user/user.service.ts` file, and add the `login()` function below to the existing `UserService` class.

``` JavaScript
login(user: User) {
    return this.http.post(
        Config.apiUrl + "user/" + Config.appKey + "/login",
        JSON.stringify({
            username: user.email,
            password: user.password
        }),
        { headers: this.getCommonHeaders() }
    ).pipe(
        map(response => response),
        tap(data => {
            Config.token = (<any>data)._kmd.authtoken
        }),
        catchError(this.handleErrors)
    );
}
```

This code hits one of this tutorial’s existing backend endpoints, and stores off an authentication token that you’ll use later in this guide.

* **b.** To use your service’s new `login()` function, return to your `app/login/login.component.ts` file, and add the following import to the top of the file:

``` JavaScript
import { Router } from "@angular/router";
```

* **c.** Next, replace the current `constructor()` declaration with the code below, which injects Angular’s `Router` service.

``` JavaScript
constructor(private router: Router, private userService: UserService) {
```

* **d.** Finally, replace the `LoginComponent`’s existing `login()` function with the code below, which calls your service’s new `login()` method, and calls the router’s `navigate()` method if `login()` completes successfully.

``` JavaScript
login() {
  this.userService.login(this.user)
    .subscribe(
      () => this.router.navigate(["/list"]),
      (exception) => {
          if(exception.error && exception.error.description) {
              alert(exception.error.description);
          } else {
              alert(exception)
          }
      }
    );
}
```

* **e.** Save your files.

* **f.** After your device updates with these changes, type in your login credentials and tap the **Sign in** button. You should navigate to the new list screen.

#### Background: More on routing in NativeScript

> **NOTE**:
> * You don’t have to add `Router` to your `LoginComponent`’s `providers` array because it’s already included in the `NativeScriptRouterModule` you’re including as an `import` in `app.module.ts`.
> * Refer to the [NativeScript navigation documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/core-concepts/angular-navigation.html) for more information on what you can do with the router in NativeScript, such as configuring alternate page transitions.

#### End Background

The power of NativeScript is you have the ability to use the same Angular conventions that you’d use in a web app—`Router` and so forth—yet get an app that fits right in on iOS and Android. Notice how on Android the hardware back button works as expected, and how your iOS app uses built-in iOS animations and conventions such as the back button.

Now that we’ve discussed how NativeScript apps and Angular web apps are similar, let’s move on to how they’re different. When you’re building with NativeScript you have access to the entirety of iOS and Android, as well as the highly capable devices they run on—enabling you to build rich experiences that go above and beyond what the web can offer.
