## Lesson 3. Basic functionality: Add tasks

The layout components let you arrange the various UI widgets of your app. Whenever you need to place more than one UI widget on your app screen, you are likely to use one of the available layout options. The `<StackLayout>` and the `<GridLayout>` are basic but versatile options, letting you position elements vertically or in a table-like layout, respectively. While the 
`<StackLayout>` displays elements in their natural sequence, the `<GridLayout>` lets you choose the exact positions of your elements in the grid.

### Step 1. Create the layout

Replace the default layout with a `<GridLayout>` and configure the grid to accommodate the UI elements of your app.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **Ð°.** Delete the `<Label>` component from the first `<TabViewItem>` block for the first tab.
* **b.** Drag and drop a `<StackLayout>` component within the `<TabViewItem>` block for the first tab.<br/>The default code creates a colorful vertical stack.
* **c.** Delete all `<Label>` components from the `<StackLayout>` block.
* **d.** Drag and drop a `<GridLayout>` component within the `<StackLayout>` block for the first tab.<br/>The default code creates a colorful table that shows how to position elements and merge grid cells.
* **e.** Delete all `<Label>` components from the `<GridLayout>` block.
* **f.** Configure the `<StackLayout>`.
    * Remove background color.
    * Set width and height.
* **g.** Configure the `<GridLayout>`.
    * Set the grid to consist of two columns and one row.
    * Set the width of the grid to 100% so that it takes the entire width of the screen.
    * Remove any additional settings for the grid.

<hr data-action="end" />

### Step 2. Add and arrange the UI elements

Arrange a `<TextField>` and a `<Button>` on the page. They form the input functionality of the app.

Use a `<ListView>` to show tasks below the input field.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Drag and drop a `<TextField>` and a `<Button>` within the `<GridLayout>` block.<br/>The Playground adds JavaScript code to your code for the first time. Note the `data()` and `methods` blocks added in the `<script>` block below. In next implementation steps, you will need to add code to these sections to create some of the app functionality.
* **b.** Drag and drop a `<ListView>` below the grid.<br/>The default code creates a list of countries and country flag icons.
* **c.** Configure the positioning of the elements within the grid.
    * Set the `<TextField>` to inhabit the first column and the first row.
    * Set the `<Button>` to inhabit the second column and the first row.
* **d.** Clean up sample code from the `<TextField>` and the `<ListView>`. Set a height for the `<ListView>`.

<hr data-action="end" />

At the end of this stage, your `<template>` block should resemble this sample:

```JavaScript
<Page class="page">
  <ActionBar title="My Tasks" class="action-bar" />
      
  <TabView height="100%">
    <TabViewItem title="To Do">
    <!-- Positions an input field, a button, and the list of tasks in a grid. -->
      <StackLayout orientation="vertical" width="100%" height="100%">
        
        <GridLayout columns="2*,*" rows="*" width="100%">
          <TextField row="0" col="0" v-model="textFieldValue" hint="Type new task..." editable="true" @returnPress="onButtonTap" /> <!-- Configures the text field and ensures that pressing Return on the keyboard produces the same result as tapping the button. -->
          <Button row="0" col="1" text="Add task" @tap="onButtonTap" />
        </GridLayout>
        
        <ListView for="todo in todos" @itemTap="onItemTap" height="100%"> <!-- Make sure to set a height or your list will not show on iOS. -->
          <v-template>
            <Label :text="todo.name" />
          </v-template>
        </ListView>
      </StackLayout> 
    </TabViewItem>

    <TabViewItem title="Completed">
      <Label text="This tab will list completed tasks for tracking." textWrap="true" />
    </TabViewItem>
  
  </TabView>
</Page>
```

### Step 3. Create the logic

Scroll down to the `<script>` block and use basic JavaScript methods to create simple logic for adding tasks.

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** Log newly added tasks in the console.
* **b.** Add newly added tasks into the array of tasks. Use `unshift` to place new items at the top of the page.
* **c.** Clear the text field after input.
* **d.** List task name on the screen.

<hr data-action="end" />

At the end of this stage, your `<script>` block should resemble this sample:

```JavaScript
<script>
  export default {
    methods: {
    onItemTap(args) {
      console.log('Task with index: ' + args.index + ' tapped'); // Logs tapped tasks in the console for debugging.
    },
    onButtonTap() {
      console.log("New task added: " + this.textFieldValue + "."); // Logs the newly added task in the console for debugging.
      this.todos.unshift({ name: this.textFieldValue }); // Adds tasks in the ToDo array. Newly added tasks are immediately shown on the screen. 
      this.textFieldValue = ""; // Clears the text field so that users can start adding new tasks immediately.
    },
  },

    data() {
    return {
      todos: [],
      textFieldValue: "",
    }
  },
}

</script>
```
