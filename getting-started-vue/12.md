## Lesson 12. Where to go from here

### Step 29. Expanding this sample

Congratulations! You successfully built a ToDo application with NativeScript and Vue.js. If you’re looking to learn more, here are a few features you can try implementing on your own:
 
* Save the users’ todos so they don’t go away every time the app restarts. You can use the [NativeScript application settings module](https://docs.nativescript.org/ns-framework-modules/application-settings).
* Allow users to share their lists using the [NativeScript social share plugin](https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-social-share).

> **TIP:**
> * You can always browse the [code samples in the NativeScript Marketplace](https://market.nativescript.org/?tab=samples&framework=all_frameworks&category=all_samples) to come up with even more things to try out in your app.
> * The final state of this tutorial is available [here](https://play.nativescript.org/?template=play-vue&id=S3fNJW&v=2), in case you got lost at any point.
