## Lesson 9. Advanced design: Styled active tasks

`<ListView>` and `<Label>` have out-of-the-box style properties that you can use to control elements such as the list separator or the text wrap within the `<template>` block. To change the font style, color, and positioning of text, you need to use CSS in the `<style scoped>` block.

To implement a style particularly for the text of active tasks, you can set an `id` for the `<Label>` element.

### Step 1. 

...

#### Action

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** Set an `id` for the `<Label>` that represents active tasks and enable text wrapping. Enabling text wrapping ensures that longer text shows properly in your list.

```HTML
<Label id="active-task" :text="todo.name" class="list-group-item-heading" />
```

* **b.** Add the `separatorColor` property and set it to `transparent` for the `<ListView>` that shows active tasks. This way, the separator will no longer appear in your list.

```HTML
<ListView class="list-group" for="todo in todos" @itemTap="onItemTap" style="height:75%" separatorColor="transparent" >
```

* **c.** In `<style scoped>`, create the style for active tasks. Set font size, color, and some padding to position the text on the page. Play with margins and paddings until you get a result that works for you.

```CSS
#active-task {
  font-size: 20;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #53ba82;
  margin-left: 20;
  padding-top: 5;
  padding-bottom: 10;
}
``` 

<hr data-action="end" />
