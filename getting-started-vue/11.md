## Lesson 11. A few masterful touches on iOS

In this lesson, you'll learn how to perform platform checks and tie platform-specific logic and design to them.

* You will improve the look and feel of the `<ActionBar>`.
* You will tweak the keyboard on iOS.
* You will add iOS-specific icons in the `<TabView>`.

### Step 1. Access the `platform` and the `frame` modules

The core `platform` module lets you get device-specific information such as device model, type, OS and OS version, language, manufacturer, and screen information. It lets you perform OS checks and implement platform- and device-specific functionality that depends on the these checks.

You will later use the `frame` to access the iOS native component behind the `<ActionBar>` and change its style and color.

To tap into the powers of these modules, you need to require them explicitly in your code.

#### Action

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** In `HelloWorld.vue` > `<script>`, require the `platform` and the `frame` module. Place these statements at the top of the block before the `export` statement.

```JavaScript
const platform = require("tns-core-modules/platform");
const frame = require("tns-core-modules/ui/frame");
```

<hr data-action="end" />

### Step 2. Improve the looks of the `<ActionBar>` on iOS

Note how the `<ActionBar>` at the top of the screen combines a dark label on a dark background for iOS. You can change this with a simple platform-specific tweak. Use the `platform.isIOS` check to run the configuration change only on iOS. Next, apply a specific iOS status bar setting.

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** In the `methods` section of the `<script>` block, add a `onPageLoaded` method at the top and create a simple `platform.isIOS` check. You will use it to manage iOS-specific changes as soon as the app screen loads.

```JavaScript
onPageLoaded: function () {
    if (platform.isIOS) { 

    }
},
```

* **b.** Call this method in the `@loaded` event for the `<Page>` element in your `<template>` block.

```HTML
<Page class="page" @loaded="onPageLoaded">
```

* **c.** Use the `frame` module to access the native iOS status bar and change its style.

```JavaScript
onPageLoaded: function () {
    if (platform.isIOS) {
        // Since the ActionBar is a dark color, this snippet of code switches the app to use
        // white text in the status bar for iOS.
        const navBar = frame.topmost().ios.controller.navigationBar;
        navBar.barStyle = UIBarStyle.UIBarStyleBlack;
    }
},
```

* **d.** Tweak the looks of the iOS keyboard by hiding the auto toolbar.

```JavaScript
IQKeyboardManager.sharedManager().enableAutoToolbar = false;
```

<hr data-action="end" />

At the end of this step, your `onPageLoaded` method should resemble this sample:

```JavaScript
onPageLoaded: function () {
    if (platform.isIOS) {
        // Since the ActionBar is a dark color, this snippet of code switches the app to use
        // white text in the status bar for iOS.
        const navBar = frame.topmost().ios.controller.navigationBar;
        navBar.barStyle = UIBarStyle.UIBarStyleBlack;

        // Hide the IQKeyboard default toolbar as it might confuse users in this simple example.
        IQKeyboardManager.sharedManager().enableAutoToolbar = false;
    }
},
```

### Step 3. Import iOS-specific icons

You can add images to use inside your app with a few clicks. Upload iOS-specific icons that you can later use to improve the look of your navigation tabs.

#### Action

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** Download this icon archive locally and unpack it.

* **b.** Point to the `app` folder and click the more options button at the far right of its line. Select **Add folder** and name the new folder `images`.

* **c.** Point to the newly created `images` folder and click the more options button at the far right of its line. Select **Upload** resources.

* **d.** Click **Browse**, navigate to the location that contains your icons. Select and upload the images that you want to use.

<hr data-action="end" />

### Step 4. Prettify your `<TabView>` on iOS with the newly imported icons

Spruce up your design by creating some iOS-specific functionality. You can use the `platform.isIOS` and `platform.isAndroid` flags to trigger platform-specific functionality.

#### Action

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** Show an icon for active tasks in the `<TabView>` for iOS. 

To check if the app is running on an iOS device, use the `platform.isIOS` check. Place the check and the logic behind it in the `data` section of the `<script>` block of your `HelloWorld.vue` file.

```JavaScript
todoIcon: platform.isIOS ? "~/./images/To-Do@3x.png" : "",
```

* **b.** To show the icon on the screen, modify the `<TabViewItem>` definition for the active tasks tab in the `<template>` block.

```HTML
<TabViewItem title="To Do" :iconSource="todoIcon" textTransform="uppercase">
```

* **c.** Show an icon for completed tasks in the `<TabView>` for iOS. Place an identical `platform.isIOS` check to the one you created in the previous step in the `data` section of the `<script>` block of your `HelloWorld.vue` file.

```JavaScript
completedIcon: platform.isIOS ? "~/./images/Completed@3x.png" : ""
```

* **d.** To show the icon on the screen, modify the `<TabViewItem>` definition for the completed tasks tab in the `<template>` block.

```HTML
<TabViewItem title="Completed" :iconSource="completedIcon" textTransform="uppercase">
```

<hr data-action="end" />

### Step 5. Prevent highlighting of tapped items

Add a method that changes the default selection style on iOS to both `<ListView>` components. By default, when you tap an item in a list view on iOS, the item is highlighted.

#### Action

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** In the `<script>` block, create a new `onItemLoading` method that changes the selection style for iOS.

```JavaScript
onItemLoading(args) {
  if (args.ios) {
    // Prevent default iOS behavior of highlighting a tapped item in a UITableView
    // See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46299915/remove-listview-item-highlight-on-tap-nativescript-angular-ios
    args.ios.selectionStyle = UITableViewCellSelectionStyle.None;
  }
},
```

* **b.** Bind the method to the `@itemLoading` event listener in both `<ListView>` components of your app.

```HTML
<ListView row="2" for="todo in todos" @itemLoading="onItemLoading">
```

```HTML
<ListView row="1" for="done in dones" @itemLoading="onItemLoading">
```
<hr data-action="end" />
