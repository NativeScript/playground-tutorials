## Lesson 9. Advanced design: Styling active tasks

### Step 21. Handle the list of active tasks

`<ListView>` and `<Label>` have out-of-the-box style properties that you can use to control aspects such as the list separator or the text wrap within the `<template>` block. To change the font style, color, and positioning of text, you need to use CSS in the `<style scoped>` block.

To implement a style that is specific to a certain group of elements in your design, you can create a new `class` for the respective elements. For example, to control the text of active tasks, you can create a `list-entry` class. You can use it as base styling for both active and completed tasks. 

Use a combination of inline and scoped CSS to style the list of active tasks.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Assign a `list-entry` class to the `<GridLayout>` that contains your active tasks. You can use it to style items in your list view. 

```HTML
<GridLayout columns="auto, *" class="list-entry">
```

* **b.** Assign the `circle` class to the tappable icon before the full text of the active task.

```HTML
<Label col="0" v-on:tap="onTodoCircleTap(todo)" class="circle" text=" " />
```

* **c.** In `<style scoped>`, create the style for list items that represent active tasks. Set padding and color.

```CSS
.list-entry {
    padding: 0 15;
    color: #42B883;
}
``` 

* **d.** In the `<style scoped>` block, define the `circle` class. Use it to handle the small tappable icons preceding the full text of each task.

```CSS
.circle {
    width: 30;
    height: 30;
    color: #42B883;
    font-size: 25;
    border-color: #42B883;
    border-width: 2;
    border-radius: 50;
}
.list-entry .circle {
    margin: 0 10 0 0;
}
```

* **e.** Use a combination of CSS `class` and a type selector for the `<Label>` components to handle the styling of the text.

```CSS
.list-entry Label {
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 17;
    vertical-align: middle;
    padding: 17 0;
    margin: 0;
}
```
<hr data-action="end" />
