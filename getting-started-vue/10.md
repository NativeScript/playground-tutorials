## Lesson 10. Advanced design: Styling completed tasks

### Step 22. Handle the list of completed tasks

In this lesson, you'll revisit knowledge from earlier parts of this tutorial.

Use a combination of inline and scoped CSS to style the list of completed tasks.

#### Action

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** Assign the existing `list-entry` and a new `list-entry-completed` class to the `<GridLayout>` that contains your completed tasks.

```HTML
<GridLayout columns="auto, *" class="list-entry list-entry-completed">
```

* **b.** Assign the `circle` class to the tappable icon before the full text of the completed task.

```HTML
<Label col="0" v-on:tap="onCompletedCircleTap(done)" class="circle" text="âœ“" />
```

* **c.** In `<style scoped>`, create the style for list items that represent completed tasks. Set color and background. Add styling for the small tappable icon before the full text of the completed task.

```CSS
.list-entry-completed .circle {
    color: white;
    background-color: #42B883;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 0;
}
```

You don't need to do additional styling for the text. It's already handled in the `.list-entry Label` section in the `<style scoped>` block. See Lesson 9 for reference.

<hr data-action="end" />

### Step 23. Apply the `completed` class to the `<ActionBar>`

Use the `v-bind` directive to apply the `completed` class to the action bar when the current tab is the tab with completed tasks. With `v-bind` you can apply conditional inline styling to certain components that might be more complicated to handle otherwise.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Based on the currently selected tab, modify the style of the action bar.

```HTML
<ActionBar title=" " flat="true" v-bind:class="{ completed: activeTabIndex == 1 }"></ActionBar>
```

<hr data-action="end" />
