## Lesson 10. Advanced design: Styled completed tasks

In this lesson, you'll revisit knowledge from earlier parts of this tutorial.

### Step 1. Handle the list of completed tasks

Use a combination of inline and scoped CSS to style the list of completed tasks.

#### Action

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** Set an `id` for the `<Label>` that represents completed tasks and enable text wrapping. Enabling text wrapping ensures that longer text shows properly in your list.

```HTML
<Label id="completed-task" :text="done.name" class="list-group-item-heading" />
```

* **b.** Add the `separatorColor` property, and set it to `transparent` for the `<ListView>` that represents completed tasks. This way, the separator will no longer appear in your list.

```HTML
<ListView id="completed-list" class="list-group" for="done in dones" @itemTap="onDoneTap" style="height:75%" separatorColor="transparent">
```

* **c.** In `<style scoped>`, create the style for completed tasks. Set font size, color, text decoration, and some padding to position the text on the page. Play with margins and paddings until you get a result that works for you.

```CSS
#completed-task {
  font-size: 20;
  color: #d3d3d3;
  margin-left: 20;
  padding-top: 5;
  padding-bottom: 10;
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
``` 

<hr data-action="end" />
