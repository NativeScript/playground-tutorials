## Lesson 10. Advanced design: Styled completed tasks

In this lesson, you'll revisit knowledge from earlier parts of this tutorial.

### Step 1. Handle the list of completed tasks

Use a combination of inline and scoped CSS to style the list of completed tasks.

#### Action

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** Assign the existing `list-entry` and a new `list-entry-completed` class to the `<GridLayout>`.

```HTML
<GridLayout columns="auto, *" class="list-entry">
```

* **b.** Assign the `circle` class to the tappable icon before the full text of the completed task.

```HTML
<Label col="0" v-on:tap="onCompletedCircleTap(done)" class="circle" text="âœ“" />
```

* **c.** In `<style scoped>`, create the style for list items that represent completed tasks. Set color and background. Add styling for the small tappable icon before the full text of the completed task.

```CSS
.list-entry-completed .circle {
    color: white;
    background-color: #42B883;
    text-align: center;
}
``` 

* **d.** Enable text wrapping for the `<Label>` element that shows the full text of the completed task. This ensures that longer text shows properly in your list.

```HTML
<Label col="1" v-on:tap="onCompletedItemTap(done)" :text="done.name" textWrap="true" />
```

You don't need to do additional styling for the text. It's already handled in the `.list-entry Label` section in the `<style scoped>` block. See Lesson 9 for reference.
