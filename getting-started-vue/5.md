## Lesson 5. Basic functionality: View, complete, and delete tasks from the To Do tab

Out-of-the-box, the `<ListView>` component detects a tap gesture for every item and emits an event for it. The event carries information about the index of the tapped array item and the array item itself. To let the user choose the outcome of a tap gesture and expand the functionality of your app, you can tie a dialog to the event.

[`dialogs`](https://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/modules/_ui_dialogs_) is a globablly available module that provides several configurable dialog types for apps: alert, action, prompt, login, confirmation. This tutorial explores the used of [`action()`](https://nativescript-vue.org/en/docs/elements/dialogs/action/) to let the user choose if they want to mark a task as completed or delete it from the list of active tasks.

### Step 1. Show completed tasks

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** In the second `<TabViewItem>` block, remove the `<Label>` element. Drag and drop a `<ListView>` element, clean up its contents, and set a height for it.

* **b.** In the newly added `<ListView>` element show items from an array of completed tasks (`dones`). Make sure to change the name of the related method from `onItemTap` to `onDoneTap`.

```HTML
<ListView class="list-group" for="done in dones" @itemTap="onDoneTap" style="height:75%">
  <v-template>
    <Label :text="done.name" class="list-group-item-heading" />
  </v-template>
</ListView>
```

<hr data-action="end" />

<<< TO DO >>> 

* **c.** Modify the `onItemTap` method.
  * Method shows an `action()` dialog.
  * Method logs user selection in the console for debugging.
  * Based on user selection, the method moves elements from the `todos` array to the `dones` array, deletes elements from the `todos` array, or dismisses the dialog. Use `splice()` to avoid leaving holes in the array and `unshift()` to make sure that recently completed tasks are shown on top.

  ```JavaScript
  onItemTap(args) {
      action('What do you want to do with this task?', 'Cancel', ['Mark completed', 'Delete forever'])
        .then(result => {
          console.log(result); // Logs the selected option for debugging.
          switch (result) {
            case 'Mark completed':
              this.dones.unshift(args.item); // Places the tapped active task at the top of the completed tasks.
              this.todos.splice(args.index, 1); // Removes the tapped active task.
              break;
            case 'Delete forever':
              this.todos.splice(args.index, 1); // Removes the tapped active task.
              break;
            case 'Cancel' || undefined: // Dismisses the dialog.
              break;
          }
      }) 
    },
  ```



### Step 2. Add and arrange the UI elements

Arrange a `<TextField>` and a `<Button>` on the page. They form the input functionality of the app.

Use a `<ListView>` to show tasks below the input field.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Drag and drop a `<TextField>` and a `<Button>` within the `<GridLayout>` block.<br/>The Playground adds JavaScript code to your code for the first time. Note the `data()` and `methods` blocks added in the `<script>` block below. In next implementation steps, you will need to add code to these sections to create some of the app functionality.
* **b.** Drag and drop a `<ListView>` below the grid.<br/>The default code creates a list of countries and country flag icons.
* **c.** Configure the positioning of the elements within the grid.
    * Set the `<TextField>` to inhabit the first column and the first row.
    * Set the `<Button>` to inhabit the second column and the first row.
* **d.** Clean up sample code from the `<TextField>` and the `<ListView>`. Set a height for the `<ListView>`.

<hr data-action="end" />

At the end of this stage, your `<template>` block should resemble this sample:

```JavaScript
<Page class="page">
  <ActionBar title="My Tasks" class="action-bar" />
      
  <TabView height="100%">
    <TabViewItem title="To Do">
    <!-- Positions an input field, a button, and the list of tasks in a grid. -->
      <StackLayout orientation="vertical" width="100%" height="100%">
        
        <GridLayout columns="2*,*" rows="*" width="100%">
          <TextField row="0" col="0" v-model="textFieldValue" hint="Type new task..." editable="true" @returnPress="onButtonTap" /> <!-- Configures the text field and ensures that pressing Return on the keyboard produces the same result as tapping the button. -->
          <Button row="0" col="1" text="Add task" @tap="onButtonTap" />
        </GridLayout>
        
        <ListView for="todo in todos" @itemTap="onItemTap" height="100%"> <!-- Make sure to set a height or your list will not show on iOS. -->
          <v-template>
            <Label :text="todo.name" />
          </v-template>
        </ListView>
      </StackLayout> 
    </TabViewItem>

    <TabViewItem title="Completed">
      <Label text="This tab will list completed tasks for tracking." textWrap="true" />
    </TabViewItem>
  
  </TabView>
</Page>
```

### Step 3. Create the logic

Scroll down to the `<script>` block and use basic JavaScript methods to create simple logic for adding tasks.

<hr data-action="start" />

* **a.** Log newly added tasks in the console.
* **b.** Add newly added tasks into the array of tasks. Use `unshift` to place new items at the top of the page.
* **c.** Clear the text field after input.
* **d.** List task name on the screen.

<hr data-action="end" />

At the end of this stage, your `<script>` block should resemble this sample:

```JavaScript
<script>
  export default {
    methods: {
    onItemTap(args) {
      console.log('Task with index: ' + args.index + ' tapped'); // Logs tapped tasks in the console for debugging.
    },
    onButtonTap() {
      console.log("New task added: " + this.textFieldValue + "."); // Logs the newly added task in the console for debugging.
      this.todos.unshift({ name: this.textFieldValue }); // Adds tasks in the ToDo array. Newly added tasks are immediately shown on the screen. 
      this.textFieldValue = ""; // Clears the text field so that users can start adding new tasks immediately.
    },
  },

    data() {
    return {
      todos: [],
      textFieldValue: "",
    }
  },
}

</script>
```
