Welcome to the NativeScript-Vue getting started guide. In this first lesson, you’ll learn how to use this Playground environment and how to get your first NativeScript-Vue app on your device.

> **TIP**:

### Step 1. The lay of the land

Right now, you're in the NativeScript Playground.

This is a browser-based environment for developing simple NativeScript apps, using any of the available integrations. You can get straight to coding without installing the various SDKs and tools needed for native iOS and Android development. All you need to complete this guide is an iOS or Android device.

Let’s see the NativeScript Playground in action.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **а.** Look around the screen.

The left sidebar offers a file explorer and a **Components** panel. Most of the effort on your app will happen in `app.js` and `app.css`, containing the app functionality and taking care of the app styles, respectively. No need to deep dive in any other files for now.

* **b.** Check out the **Components** panel.

The **Components** panel provides quick access to already pre-configured code for all available NativeScript UI components. The search box provides a shortcut to reaching the component you want to use without scrolling through the list.

You can quickly add components to your app with drag-and-drop.

* **c.** Examine the top menu bar.

From the top of the page, you can push changes to the preview apps on your device (more about those later), save, and download your code.

* **d.** Get familiar with the bottom of the page.

The bottom of the page is your best friend, providing real-time error reports and device logs.
