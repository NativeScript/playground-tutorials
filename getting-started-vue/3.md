## Lesson 3. Basic app design

The `components` > `HelloWorld.vue` file holds both the design and the code-behind logic. The `<template>` block nests all user interface elements.

The `<Page>` element is the top-level user interface element of every NativeScript-Vue app. All other user interface elements are nested within.

The `<ActionBar>` element shows an action bar for the `<Page>`. A `<Page>` cannot contain more than one `<ActionBar>`.

Typically, after the `<ActionBar>`, you will have navigation components (such as a drawer or a tab view) or layout components. These elements control the layout of your app and let you determine how to place other user interface elements inside.

### Step 1. Create a two-tab app

Use the `<TabView>` component to create a two-tab app.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **Ð°.** Change the title of the `<ActionBar>` to reflect the app purpose.
* **b.** Remove the default `<ScrollView>` block and all its contents that come with the template.<br/>`<ScrollView>` components are top-level layout containers for scrollable content.
* **c.** Drag and drop the `<TabView>` component in its place.<br/>The Playground applies some code formatting, including taking care of indentation.
* **d.** Configure the height of the `<TabView>` to fill the screen (set it to 100%).
* **e.** Change the titles of the `<TabViewItem>` elements and their contents to reflect their purpose.<br/>At this point, text content for the tabs is shown in `<Label>` components with no styling and formatting. Apply the `textWrap="true"` property to the respective `<Label>` components to improve the visualization of the text.

<hr data-action="end" />

At the end of this stage, your `<template>` block should resemble this sample:

```HTML
<template>
  <Page class="page">
    <ActionBar title="My Tasks" class="action-bar" />
    
    <TabView height="100%">
      <TabViewItem title="To Do">
        <Label text="This tab will list active tasks and will let users add new tasks." textWrap="true" />
      </TabViewItem>
      
      <TabViewItem title="Completed">
        <Label text="This tab will list completed tasks for tracking." textWrap="true" />
      </TabViewItem>
    
    </TabView>
  </Page>
</template>
```
