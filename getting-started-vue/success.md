Now that you’ve learned the NativeScript-Vue basics, you’re ready to move on to your own work.

You can continue development in the Playground, or, if you prefer to work in a local development environment, you can continue in [NativeScript Sidekick](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick) or the [NativeScript command-line interface](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/tutorial/ng-chapter-1).

As always, if you get stuck, feel free to reach for help on [**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nativescript) or ask our experts in [**NativeScript community Slack channel**](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation). Have fun building with NativeScript!
